Description of the project:

In this project, i emplemented an intelligent algorithm that detects the age range of a person in a picture. This project was done 
using AI techniques such as knn - random forest - decision tree. The use of keras as well as openCV was used to detect the anthopometric
facial features of a person in order to detect the age of that person.
